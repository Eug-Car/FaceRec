# FaceRec
Python face recognition algorithm to prevent my roommate from using my laptop.

Using dlib and face_recognition lib through a CPU based model (hog) allow to recognize faces captured from the webcam with a certain accuracy displayed on screen.

Just create a dir "faces" and put there images of the person you want to recognize by naming them with the name of the person you want to recognize.
